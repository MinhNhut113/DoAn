# Cleanup Report

Date: 2025-12-09

Summary: Deleted files/dirs per user approval (A).

Deleted items:
- `API_INCORRECT_ANSWERS.md`
- `BAT_DAU_NHANH.md`
- `frontend/test-connection.html`
- `.vscode/` (directory)

Kept (important):
- `backend/` (source code) — did NOT delete `.env` inside `backend/`.
- `frontend/` (source)
- `database/` (schemas and seeds)
- `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`

Notes:
- Deletions were performed permanently in the workspace. To recover any deleted content, restore from git history or external backups if available.
- If you want to also remove `backend/.env` (if present) or compress/archive removed files instead of deleting, tell me and I will proceed.
